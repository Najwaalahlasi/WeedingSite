		      <p> Frequent item set mining based on the FP-growth (frequent pattern growth) algorithm,
		       which employs an extended prefix-tree (FP-tree) structure to store the database in a compressed form.
		       The FP-growth algorithm is currently one of the fastest approaches to discover frequent item sets.
		       FP-growth adopts a divide-and-conquer approach to decompose both the mining tasks and the databases.
		       It uses a pattern fragment growth method to avoid the costly process of candidate generation and testing used by Apriori.
